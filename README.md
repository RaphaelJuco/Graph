# Graph
Using Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine the most direct path between two airports.

Reads in the data file AirportDistances.txt. Preview the document which contains three fields in each record. These field are an airport code, a second airport code, and the distance between the two airports.  The airport codes are three character strings and the distance (which is in statute miles) is an integer. 

Using the input file construct a graph with the two airport codes as vertices and the distance as the value of the edge between those two vertices. 

Your program will then accept input of two airport codes and determine the shortest distance between those two airport codes using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
